# Migration versions overview

This directory stores Alembic revision modules executed in chronological order.
Each file defines `revision`, `down_revision`, and paired `upgrade()`/`downgrade()` functions.

Use descriptive filenames that encode the date and purpose, and keep schema changes reversible when feasible.
